# Sentiment Analysis with Multiclasses Classification Algorithms


## Introduction

In the context of Machine Learning, the classification task can be approached in several ways, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this project, we will implement a variety of multi-class classification algorithms to identify the most effective model for analyzing sentiment in texts from social networks.

By the end of this project, we hope to not only identify the best classification model, but also gain a deeper understanding of how different text vectorization techniques and machine learning algorithms interact and influence the accuracy of sentiment analysis.
